<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This script organizes labeled images into separate folders based on their class names. It reads class names from a text file named <code>classes.txt</code> and creates corresponding directories for each class. Then, it copies and removes each label and image file to its own folder based on the class index.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a <code>classes.txt</code> file with class names separated by new lines.</li>
  <li>Place your label and image files in the <code>labels/</code> and <code>images/</code> directories, respectively.</li>
  <li>Run the script using the following command: <code>python script_name.py</code>. Replace <code>script_name.py</code> with the name of the script file.</li>
</ol>
